---

This document will help you upgrade from antd `3.x` version to antd `4.x` version. If you are using `2.x` or older version, please refer to the previous [upgrade document](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/blob/2adf8ced24da7b3cb46a3475854a83d76a98c536/CHANGELOG.en-US.md#300) to 3.x.

## Upgrade preparation

1. Please upgrade to the latest version of 3.x first, and remove / modify related APIs according to the console warning message.
2. Upgrade project React 16.12.0 or above.
   - If you are still using React 15, please refer to [React 16 Upgrade Documentation](https://reactjs.org/blog/2017/09/26/react-v16.0.html#breaking-changes).
   - For the remaining React 16 obsolete lifecycle APIs, please refer to [Migration Guide](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/03/27/update-on-async-rendering.html#gradual-migration-path).

#### Icon upgrade

In `antd @ 3.9.0`, we introduced the svg icon ([Why use the svg icon?](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/issues/10353)). The icon API using the string name cannot be loaded on demand, so the svg icon file is fully introduced, which greatly increases the size of the packaged product. In 4.0, we adjusted the icon usage API to support tree shaking, reducing the default package size of antd by about 150 KB (Gzipped).

Legacy Icon usage will be discarded:

```jsx
import { Icon, Button } from 'antd';

const Demo = () => (
  <div>
    <Icon type="smile" />
    <Button icon="smile" />
  </div>
);
```

It will be imported on demand in v4:

```diff
  import { Button } from 'antd';

  // tree-shaking supported
- import { Icon } from 'antd';
+ import { SmileOutlined } from '@ant-design/icons';

  const Demo = () => (
      <div>
-       <Icon type="smile" />
+       <SmileOutlined />
      <Button icon={<SmileOutlined />} />
    </div>
  );

  // or directly import
  import SmileOutlined from '@ant-design/icons/SmileOutlined';
```

You will still be able to continue using the compatibility pack:

```jsx
import { Button } from 'antd';
import { Icon } from '@ant-design/compatible';

const Demo = () => (
  <div>
    <Icon type="smile" />
    <Button icon="smile" />
  </div>
);
```

#### Component refactoring

- Form rewrite.
  - No need to use `Form.create`.
  - Nest fields definition changes from `'xxx.yyy'` to `['xxx', 'yyy']`.
  - See [here](/components/form/v3) for migration documentation.
- DatePicker rewrite
  - Provide the `picker` property for selector switching.
  - Range selection can now select start and end times individually.
  - `onPanelChange` will also trigger when panel value changed.
  - [Date cell className of Custom style demo](/components/date-picker/#components-date-picker-demo-date-render) changed from `ant-calendar-date` to `ant-picker-cell-inner`.
- Tree, Select, TreeSelect, AutoComplete rewrite
  - use virtual scrolling.
  - `onBlur` no longer trigger value change and return React origin `event` object instead.
  - AutoComplete no longer support `optionLabelProp`. Please set Option `value` directly.
  - Select remove `dropdownMenuStyle` prop.
  - Use `listHeight` to config popup height instead of `dropdownStyle`.
  - `filterOption` return origin data with second params instead. No need to use `option.props.children` for matching.
- The Grid component uses flex layout.
- Button's `danger` is now treated as a property instead of a button type.
- Input, Select set `value` to `undefined` is uncontrolled mode now.
- Table rewrite.
  - will keep at least one column even if `columns` is empty.
  - Nest `dataIndex` definition changes from `'xxx.yyy'` to `['xxx', 'yyy']`.
- Pagination will default set `showSizeChanger` to `true` since `4.1.0`. This change also applied on Table component.

```diff
<Table
  columns={[
    {
      title: 'Age',
-     dataIndex: 'user.age',
+     dataIndex: ['user', 'age'],
    },
  ]}
/>
```

## Start upgrading

You can manually check the code one by one against the above list for modification. In addition, we also provide a codemod cli tool [@ant-design/codemod-v4](https://github.com/ant-design/codemod-v4) To help you quickly upgrade to v4.

Before running codemod cli, please submit your local code changes.

```shell
# Run directly through npx
npx -p @ant-design/codemod-v4 antd4-codemod src

# Or global installation
# Use npm
npm i -g @ant-design/codemod-v4
# Use yarn
yarn global add @ant-design/codemod-v4

# Execute
antd4-codemod src
```

<img src="https://gw.alipayobjects.com/mdn/rms_08e378/afts/img/A*QdcbQoLC-cQAAAAAAAAAAABkARQnAQ" alt="codemod running" width="720" />

For parts that cannot be modified automatically, codemod will prompt on the command line, and it is recommended to modify them manually as prompted. After modification, you can run the above command repeatedly to check.

> Note that codemod cannot cover all scenarios, and it is recommended to check for incompatible changes one by one.

### Migration tool modification details

`@ant-design/codemod-v4` will help you migrate to antd v4. Obsolete components will be kept running through @ant-design/compatible. Generally, you don't need to migrate manually. The following sections detail the overall migration and changes.

#### Import the obsolete Form and Mention components via @ant-design/compatible package

```diff
- import { Form, Input, Button, Mention } from 'antd';
+ import { Form, Mention } from '@ant-design/compatible';
+ import '@ant-design/compatible/assets/index.css';
+ import { Input, Button } from 'antd';

  ReactDOM.render( (
    <div>
      <Form>
        {getFieldDecorator('username')(<Input />)}
        <Button>Submit</Button>
      </Form>
      <Mention
        style={{ width: '100%' }}
        onChange={onChange}
        defaultValue={toContentState('@afc163')}
        defaultSuggestions={['afc163', 'benjycui']}
        onSelect={onSelect}
      />
    </div>
  );
```

> **Note:** Old Form imported from `@ ant-design / compatible` has change the class name from `.ant-form` to `.ant-legacy-form`. Need to be modified accordingly if override the style.

#### Replace component's string icon prop with the new `@ant-design/icons`

```diff
  import { Avatar, Button, Result } from 'antd';
+ import { QuestionOutlined, UserOutlined } from '@ant-design/icons';

  ReactDOM.render(
    <div>
-     <Button type="primary" shape="circle" icon="search" />
+     <Button type="primary" shape="circle" icon={SearchOutlined} />
-     <Avatar shape="square" icon="user" />
+     <Avatar shape="square" icon={UserOutlined} />
      <Result
-       icon="question"
+       icon={<QuestionOutlined />}
        title="Great, we have done all the operations!"
        extra={<Button type="primary">Next</Button>}
      />
    </div>,
    mountNode,
  );

```

#### Replace v3 Icon with `@ant-design/icons`

```diff
- import { Icon, Input } from 'antd';
+ import { Input } from 'antd';
+ import Icon, { CodeFilled, SmileOutlined, SmileTwoTone } from '@ant-design/icons';

  const HeartSvg = () => (
    <svg width="1em" height="1em" fill="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 1024 1024">
      <path d="M923 plapla..." />
    </svg>
  );

  const HeartIcon = props => <Icon component={HeartSvg} {...props} />;

  ReactDOM.render(
    <div>
-     <Icon type="code" theme="filled" />
+     <CodeFilled />
-     <Icon type="smile" theme="twoTone" twoToneColor="#eb2f96" />
+     <SmileTwoTone twoToneColor="#eb2f96" />
-     <Icon type="code" theme={props.fill ? 'filled' : 'outlined'} />
+     <LegacyIcon type="code" theme={props.fill ? 'filled' : 'outlined'} />
      <HeartIcon />
      <Icon viewBox="0 0 24 24">
        <title>Cool Home</title>
        <path d="M10 20v-6h4v6h5v-8h3L12 3 2 12h3v8z" />
      </Icon>
      <Input suffix={<SmileOutlined />} />
    </div>,
    mountNode,
  );

```

#### Replace v3 LocaleProvider with v4 ConfigProvider

```diff
- import { LocaleProvider } from 'antd';
+ import { ConfigProvider } from 'antd';

  ReactDOM.render(
-   <LocaleProvider {...yourConfig}>
+   <ConfigProvider {...yourConfig}>
      <Main />
-   </LocaleProvider>
+   </ConfigProvider>
    mountNode,
  );
```

#### Replace `Modal.method()` icon string with `@ant-design/icons`

```diff
  import { Modal } from 'antd';
+ import { AntDesignOutlined } from '@ant-design/icons';

  Modal.confirm({
-  icon: 'ant-design',
+  icon: <AntDesignOutlined />,
   title: 'Do you Want to delete these items?',
   content: 'Some descriptions',
   onOk() {
     console.log('OK');
   },
   onCancel() {
     console.log('Cancel');
   },
 });
```

## Encounter problems

v4 made a lot of detailed improvements and refactoring. We collected all known incompatible changes and related impacts as much as possible, but there may be some scenarios we have not considered. If you encounter problems during the upgrade, please go to [GitHub issues](http://new-issue.ant.design/) and [codemod Issues](https://github.com/ant-design/codemod-v4/issues) for feedback. We will respond and improve this document as soon as possible.
